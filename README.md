Given Task:
# Task Description
Your task is to write a Python program to fetch research papers based on a user-specified query. The program must identify papers with at least one author affiliated with a pharmaceutical or biotech company and return the results as a CSV file.
# Problem Details
1. Source of Papers

    ○ Fetch papers using the PubMed API

    ○ The program should support PubMed's full query syntax for flexibility.
2. Output Requirements

   ○ Return the results as a CSV file with the following columns:

           ■ PubmedID: Unique identifier for the paper.

           ■ Title: Title of the paper.

           ■ Publication Date: Date the paper was published.

           ■ Non-academic Author(s): Names of authors affiliated with non-academic institutions.

           ■ Company Affiliation(s): Names of pharmaceutical/biotech companies.

           ■ Corresponding Author Email: Email address of the corresponding author.
3. Command-line Program Features

   ○ Accept the query as a command-line argument.

   ○ Provide the following options:

           ■ -h or --help: Display usage instructions.

           ■ -d or --debug: Print debug information during execution.

           ■ -f or --file: Specify the filename to save the results. If this option is not provided, print the output to the console.
4. Code Organization and Environment

   ○ Version Control:

           ■ Use Git for version control. The code must be hosted on GitHub.

   ○ Dependencies and Setup:

           ■ Use Poetry for dependency management and packaging.

           ■ Ensure that running poetry install sets up all dependencies.
    ○ Execution:

           ■ Provide an executable command named get-papers-list via Poetry.
5. Documentation

   ○ Include a README.md file with the following details:

           ■ How the code is organized.

           ■ Instructions on how to install dependencies and execute the program.

           ■ Mention any tools (e.g., LLMs or libraries) used to build the program, along with relevant links.
6. Evaluation Criteria

   ○ Functional Requirements:

           ■ Adherence to the problem statement.

           ■ Ability to fetch and filter results correctly.

   ○ Non-functional Requirements:

           ■ Typed python: Using types everywhere.

           ■ Performance: Efficiency of API calls and processing.

           ■ Readability: Clear and maintainable code with appropriate comments and docstrings.

           ■ Organization: Logical separation of concerns (e.g., modular functions and classes).

           ■ Robustness: Error handling for invalid queries, API failures, or missing data.
# Bonus points
Each of these additional points

1. Break the program into two parts: a module and a command line program that uses the module.

2. Publish the module in test-pypi.
# Notes

● You are free to use LLM tools or other resources to assist in development – please s

● Clearly document any external tools used in the README.md.

● Assume the program will be evaluated by automated scripts, so strict adherence to conventions
is required.

● How to identify non-academic authors? You can apply any heuristics (email addresses, words like
university, labs etc).
